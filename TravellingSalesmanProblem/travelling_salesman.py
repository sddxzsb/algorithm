"""
tsp.txt is a data file describing a TSP instance.

The first line indicates the number of cities.  Each city is a point in the
plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single
city. The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance ---
that is, two cities at locations (x,y) and (z,w) have distance
sqrt{(x-z)^2 + (y-w)^2} between them.
